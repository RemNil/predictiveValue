# Predictive Value
Drawing on recent work in Bayesian epistemology and predictive modelling, this project explores the conceputal underpinnings of the value of predictions as tool for epistemic justification in biomedical research.

## Probability-Raising Account (with Epistemic Probabilities)  
Evidence *E* confirms hypothesis *H* relative to background *K* iff:  
$Prob\left(H/E\wedge K\right) > Prob\left(H/E\right)$, where $Prob$ is an epistemic probability function.
